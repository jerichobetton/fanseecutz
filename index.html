      <div class='descriptionText'>"Cutting hair is something I loved doing
        since I was a little kid. My mother was a hair
        stylist so I grew up hanging around the shop life. I also knew I would go to barber school one day and become a
        great barber. While there's always learning to be done, I strive to do my best one canvas at a time. Making
        people
        feel good about themselves is one thing that keeps me going. It's so amazing to see what a haircut could do and
        how it can make a person feel."
